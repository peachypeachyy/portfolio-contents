# Finding correlations between gdp per capita and working hours per week.

## Description

This project is an academic project which involves finding a correlation between gdp per capita and number of working hours per week.
The general idea behind this is that there is a prejudice that undertaking more work would lead to higher income. The aim of this project is to validate that and check if truly does increase in number of working hours directly result in higher gdp per capita.

## Technologies used

    - R and R Studio 4.3


## Methodology

The project involves 4 main tasks

    1. Data Cleaning and pre-processing
    2. Data visualization and trend identification
    3. Formulations of Linear regression equations to model the relationships
    4. Confirm the bias based on cluster analysis.


1. The Data Cleaning and pre-processing was mostly done in R itself using base libraries by creating functions and using `pivot_longer()` functions to transform data into columns for further processing
