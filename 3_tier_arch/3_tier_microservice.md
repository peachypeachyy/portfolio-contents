## Description :

The aim of this architecture is to create a distributed microservice based architecture with a segregated frontend connected with a central API management layer. This allows the API's to be secured, rate limited in case of sudden spikes of traffic, authenticated and authorized from a central command plane and enables the system to monetize any external APIs if required.
