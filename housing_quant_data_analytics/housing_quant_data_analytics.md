# Prediction of House Prices

The project is an academic project where data is being provided to provide advise on purchase of property based on the agents and different suburbs. This project uses stata to identify a linear regression with interaction variables to understand the influence of one variable over another.

## Technologies Used
    - Stata
    - Excel

# Methodology

The project aims to use quantitative reasoning to use data to devise a decision of which agent should be used to make a home purchase. The first step involves data transformation and identification of outliers in both the suburbs which can skew our results.

On removing them, we can create interaction variables to identify the relation between each variable. finally we can derive an equation which has a high value of R-square.

Using the co-efficients associated with each variable, we can derive the linear regression equation and then input in values for AGENT to understand which agent can provide us with a better sale value.

In order to ascertain the validity of our results, the tests of Normality, Multi-Collinearity, Heteroskedacity, tests for functional forms etc were also performed.

# Learnings

In this academic project, I was able to learn and apply principles of using Linear regression for prediction of a dependent variable(Price) against independent variables with confidence intervals and use various tests to validate the accuracy of the model.
